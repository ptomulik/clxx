 * \brief This module documents \ref clxx_x10d package
 *
 * The name "x10d" (pron. "x-tend", or "extend") is kind a temporary for lack
 * of better one.
 *
 * The package extends the basic clxx interface to OpenCL contained in
 * \ref clxx_cl package. As for now it's quite disorganized, it's a work in
 * progress.
 *
 * \par Linking
 *
 * Programs which use this package should be linked against \c libclxx_x10d
 * library (\c -lclxx_x10d).
