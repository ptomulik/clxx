{% include JB/setup %}

<p>Basically, this sublayer provides two elements</p>
<ul>
  <li>a set of C++11 enum classes to represent most of the OpenCL constants in a type-safe way,</li>
  <li>a set of C++ functions, that map 1-to-1 to functions of the OpenCL API.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/devel/arch/types.hpp.html">types</a> page lists the OpenCL constants and their corresponding clxx enums.</p>

<p>The <a href="/devel/arch/functions.hpp.html">functions</a> page lists the OpenCL functions and their corresponding clxx functions.</p>
